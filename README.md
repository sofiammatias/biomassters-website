# BioMassters Website

This repository contains the code for the API demo website of the BioMassters project.

See BioMasssters README file [here](https://github.com/sofiammatias/project-biomassters/blob/master/README.md) and the link to the repo [here](https://github.com/sofiammatias/project-biomassters/)

This website was build with **Python** and **Streamlit** to present a live API with our deep learning model to estimate biomass in a Finnish forest.
Here is our demo website with our deep learning model API:

By the time we have done the video, the API was no longer live, as **Google Cloud** services are paid, and we've run the API and the website locally. 
However, it was live by the time we had to present our project: both API and the Streamlit website were online.
